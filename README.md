# R3D - 3D Rendering Library for raylib

<img  align="left" style="width:152px" src="https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d/blob/master/logo.png" width="124px">

R3D is a 3D rendering library designed to work with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). It offers features for lighting, shadows, materials, post effects, and more.

R3D is ideal for developers who want to add 3D rendering to their raylib projects without building a full rendering engine from scratch.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid Renderer**: Supports both deferred and forward rendering. You can force a mode globally (always deferred or always forward), or let the engine choose the optimal path based on rendering parameters.
- **Material System**: Uses raylib’s material system—just load a model and set its material maps, R3D takes care of the rest.
- **Lighting**: Supports directional, spot, and omni lights, fully integrated with both deferred and forward rendering paths.
- **Shadow Mapping**: Soft shadows (PCSS) with per-light resolution and dynamic update modes (manual, interval, or per-frame).
- **Skyboxes**: HDR and non-HDR skybox rendering with IBL (image-based lighting) support.
- **Post-processing Effects**: Includes SSAO, bloom, fog, tonemapping, color grading, FXAA, and more.
- **Instanced Rendering**: Render instances with per-instance transform matrices, optional global matrix, and color instances support.
- **Frustum Culling**: Shape-based visibility testing (bounding box, sphere, point) to cull unseen objects efficiently.
- **Blit Management**: Renders at internal resolution and blits to screen or texture with aspect ratio controls.
- **CPU Particles**: Particle system simulated on CPU, with support for dynamic curves for size over lifetime and other interpolated properties.
- **3D Sprites**: Render 3D-facing sprites with support for sprite sheet animations.
- **Billboard Rendering**: Billboards now supported across all render types—meshes, instanced geometry, particles, and sprites.

## Getting Started

To use R3D, you must have [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) installed, or if you don’t have it, clone the repository with the command:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d
```

If you have already cloned the repository without cloning raylib with it, you can do:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Prerequisites

To build and use R3D, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **raylib 5.6-dev or later**  
  R3D currently requires raylib version 5.6-dev (from the master branch) or newer. This is because it relies on a specific fix related to default tangent generation, see [commit c647d337](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/commit/c647d337034585251d3d76d32093ac88a4c4ab82) for details.

  By default, R3D uses `find_package(raylib)` to detect a system-installed version. If you don't have the required version installed, or prefer not to install it manually, you can enable the `R3D_RAYLIB_VENDORED` CMake option to use the vendored version included as a Git submodule.

  To clone the submodule, refer to the **Getting Started** section.

- **Python (>= 3.6)**
  Required for shader minification, which integrates optimized shaders into the library's binary.

- **C Compiler**
  A compiler supporting C99 or later is necessary for building the project.

- **CMake**
  Used to configure and build the library.

### Compatibility  

R3D requires an OpenGL 3.3+ compatible driver. OpenGL ES support is not yet available but is planned for future updates.

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d
   cd r3d
   ```

2. **Optional: Clone raylib submodule**:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Build the library**:

   Use CMake to configure and build the library.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. **Link the library to your project**:

   - R3D is a CMake project, and you can include it in your own CMake-based project via `add_subdirectory()` or by linking directly to the built library.
   - If you're using it as the main project, you can build the examples using the option `R3D_BUILD_EXAMPLES` in CMake.
   - If you want to build R3D as a shared library, use the CMake option `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`.

5. **Cross Compilation**:

   You can also perform cross-compilation on Linux for Windows using MinGW.

   #### Prerequisites
   Ensure that MinGW is installed on your system. For example, on a Debian or Ubuntu-based system, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
   ```

   #### Project Configuration
   Once inside the `build` directory, use one of the following commands depending on the target architecture:

   - **For Windows 32-bit**:
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-w32-x86_64.cmake
   ```

   - **For Windows 64-bit**:
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake
   ```

## Usage

### Initialize R3D

To initialize R3D, you need to specify the internal resolution in which it will render, as well as the flags that determine how it should operate. You can simply set them to '0' to start.  

Here is a basic example:

```c
#include <r3d.h>

int main()
{
    // Initialize raylib window
    InitWindow(800, 600, "R3D Example");

    // Initialize R3D Renderer with default settings
    R3D_Init(800, 600, 0);

    // Load a model to render
    Model model = LoadModelFromMesh(GenMeshSphere(1.0f, 16, 32));

    // Setup material with default values
    R3D_SetMaterialOcclusion(&model.materials[0], NULL, 1.0f);
    R3D_SetMaterialRoughness(&model.materials[0], NULL, 1.0f);
    R3D_SetMaterialMetalness(&model.materials[0], NULL, 0.0f);

    // Create a directional light
    // NOTE: The direction will be normalized
    R3D_Light light = R3D_CreateLight(R3D_LIGHT_DIR);
    R3D_SetLightDirection(light, (Vector3) { -1, -1, -1 });
    R3D_SetLightActive(light, true);

    // Init a Camera3D
    Camera3D camera = {
        .position = (Vector3) { -3, 3, 3 },
        .target = (Vector3) { 0, 0, 0 },
        .up = (Vector3) { 0, 1, 0 },
        .fovy = 60.0f,
        .projection = CAMERA_PERSPECTIVE
    };

    // Main rendering loop
    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
        BeginDrawing();
        R3D_Begin(camera);
        R3D_DrawModel(model, (Vector3) { 0 }, 1.0f);
        R3D_End();
        EndDrawing();
    }

    // Close R3D renderer and raylib
    UnloadModel(model);
    R3D_Close();
    CloseWindow();

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic 3D scene using R3D:

1. Initializes a raylib window (800x600 pixels).  
2. Calls `R3D_Init()` to set up the R3D renderer with the default internal resolution (same as the raylib window).  
3. Loads and renders a simple cube model using `LoadModelFromMesh()`.  
4. Sets some material values, as raylib doesn't initialize them by default. `NULL` is used for the texture, meaning the current (default) texture is kept, then we assign the material map factor.  
5. Creates a directional light to illuminate the scene. R3D automatically normalizes the direction.  
6. Initializes a `Camera3D` to view the scene.  
7. Runs the main loop, rendering the cube and light until the window is closed.  
8. Closes the R3D renderer and raylib window properly.  

### Adding Lights

R3D supports several types of lights, each with its own behavior and characteristics. You can create and manage lights as shown below:

```c
R3D_Light light = R3D_CreateLight(R3D_SPOTLIGHT, 0);                    // Adds a spotlight, without shadows (zero parameter)
R3D_SetLightPositionTarget(light, (Vector3){0, 10, 0}, (Vector3){0});   // Set light position and target
```

The `R3D_CreateLight()` function takes one parameter: the light type, which remains constant for the light's lifetime.

R3D supports the following light types:

1. **R3D_DIRLIGHT (Directional Light)**:
   - Simulates sunlight, casting parallel rays of light in a specific direction across the entire scene.
   - Useful for outdoor environments where consistent lighting over large areas is required.

2. **R3D_SPOTLIGHT (Spotlight)**:
   - Emits a cone-shaped beam of light from a specific position, pointing toward a target.
   - Requires defining both the light's **position** and its **target** to determine the direction of the beam.
   - Spotlights include the following configurable parameters:
     - **Range**: Defines how far the spotlight reaches before fading out completely.
     - **Inner Cutoff**: The angle of the cone where the light is at full intensity.
     - **Outer Cutoff**: The angle where the light fades out to darkness.
     - **Attenuation**: Controls how the light intensity decreases with distance, enabling realistic falloff effects.

3. **R3D_OMNILIGHT (Omni Light)**:
   - A point light that radiates uniformly in all directions, similar to a light bulb.
   - Requires a **position** but does not use a direction or target.
     - **Range**: Determines the maximum distance the light affects objects before fading out.
     - **Attenuation**: Controls how the light intensity decreases with distance, enabling realistic falloff effects.

### Drawing a Model

To draw a model in the scene, use the `R3D_DrawModel()` methods. There are three possible variants:

- `void R3D_DrawModel(const R3D_Model* model)`
- `void R3D_DrawModelEx(const R3D_Model* model, Vector3 position, float scale)`
- `void R3D_DrawModelPro(const R3D_Model* model, Vector3 position, Vector3 rotationAxis, float rotationAngle, Vector3 scale)`

These functions work like raylib’s but differ internally. The only visible difference is that they don’t take a tint. This is due to implementation details, but you can still set the color in your material’s albedo map.

Otherwise, the types used are the same as in raylib, so you can load them directly with raylib, here’s an example:

```c
Model model = LoadModel("model.obj");
R3D_DrawModel(model, (Vector3) { 0 }, 1.0f);
```

---

## Additional Notes

- **Shadow Mapping**: Supports shadows for point, spot, and directional lights. When creating a light, you can specify a shadow map resolution. Shadows can still be disabled later using the `R3D_DisableLightShadow` function:  

```c
R3D_EnableLightShadow(light, 2048);     // Enable shadow mapping with a 2048x2048 shadow map resolution
R3D_DisableLightShadow(light, false);   // Disables the light; `false` keeps the allocated shadow map, while `true` destroys it
```

- **Material System**: R3D uses raylib’s materials but provides helper functions to simplify setup, as raylib doesn’t always initialize all values and configuring a model’s material can be repetitive.  

```c
Material material = LoadMaterialDefault();  // Provided by raylib  

// Sets the material's albedo with a texture (copied) and a tint.
R3D_SetMaterialAlbedo(&material, &myTexture, WHITE);

// Sets roughness; `NULL` keeps the existing texture.
// If none was set, R3D assigns a default one.
R3D_SetMaterialRoughness(&material, NULL, 1.0f);

// Metalness and roughness should be set together.
// By default, both are 0, similar to smooth plastic.
R3D_SetMaterialMetalness(&material, NULL, 0.0f);

// It’s recommended to set occlusion to `1` by default.
// Otherwise, shadowed areas may appear completely black.
// While it may seem logical for the value to be inverted,
// for standard formats, like GLB, `1` should be interpreted as no occlusion.  
R3D_SetMaterialOcclusion(&material, NULL, 1.0f);

// If no emission texture is assigned, R3D defaults it to black.
// Calling this function with `NULL` changes it to white, assuming you want emission.
// But don't panic! If the factor is `0`, the material won’t emit light.  
R3D_SetMaterialEmission(&material, NULL, RED, 3.0f);
```  

- **Post-processing**: Post-processing effects like fog, bloom, tonemapping or color correction can be added at the end of the rendering pipeline using R3D's built-in shaders.
