# R3D Roadmap

## **v0.8**

* [ ] **Add Support for Custom Screen-Space Shaders (Post-Processing)**
  Allow custom shaders to be used in screen-space for post-processing effects.

* [ ] **Add Support for Custom Material Shaders**
  Allow custom shaders per material. This will likely require a different approach for deferred vs. forward rendering. Deferred mode will probably offer fewer possibilities than forward mode for custom material shaders.

* [ ] **Better logs**
  Add better logs for initialization, shutdown, loading operations, and failures.

## **Ideas (Not Planned Yet)**

* [ ] Improve support for shadow/transparency interaction (e.g., colored shadows).
* [ ] Implement Cascaded Shadow Maps (or alternative) for directional lights.
* [ ] Make wiki pages for the repo, consider it for the release.
