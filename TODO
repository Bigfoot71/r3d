- Improve the algorithm for selecting the appropriate lights in the scene.
- Provide an easy way to define the desired number of lights in the shader (preferably configurable at runtime).
- Review resource allocation so that it only occurs when a feature requires it, similar to how framebuffers are handled.
- Add support for blend modes.
- Add support for transparency.
- Implement CSM (Cascaded Shadow Maps) for directional shadows.
- Implement SSR (Screen Space Reflections) with an example.
