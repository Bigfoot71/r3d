--- Before first release ---

- Sprite3D

--- Next version ---

- Provide an easy way to define the desired number of lights in the shader (forward) (preferably configurable at runtime).
- Review resource allocation so that it only occurs when a feature requires it, similar to how framebuffers are handled.
- Implement a system to save loaded skyboxes along with their generated irradiance and prefiltered textures, allowing for later reloading.
- Add support for blend modes.
- Implement CSM (Cascaded Shadow Maps) for directional shadows.
- Implement SSR (Screen Space Reflections) with an example.
- Implement support for shadow transparency interaction (colored shadows?)
