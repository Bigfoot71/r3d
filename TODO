- PBR ambient lighting (without skybox)
- Automatic frustum culling (can be disabled with a flag)
- Adding texcoord scale/offset and normal scale to R3D_Material

- Apply the alpha scissor test directly in the depth shaders (this will work for both forward rendering and shadow maps).  
- Create an internal inclusion system for shaders to reduce GLSL code duplication.
- Provide an easy way to define the desired number of lights in the shader (forward) (preferably configurable at runtime).
- Implement a system to save loaded skyboxes along with their generated irradiance and prefiltered textures, allowing for later reloading.
- Implement CSM (Cascaded Shadow Maps) for directional shadows.
- Implement SSR (Screen Space Reflections) with an example.
- Implement better support for shadow and transparency interaction (colored shadows?)
